Another day, another blog.

## I'm finally static

After a few years with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), I've switched to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). No more database management and continual upgrades for me.

## What's going on here?

My name is Matthew Vince and I'm a web & software developer, by day and night.  I work my day job in the C# world and night time usually in Ruby, PHP or any number of other languages.  I plan on using this blog to document my findings, opinions and frustrations with programming. Will I be successful? Here's hoping. Should you follow along? Yes!
